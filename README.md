# Mylo's Component Library

## WHY?

I've found myself writing the same thing over and over so I decided to make a \
little library that I can update to save me some time in the future.

I know I COULD just use a library, but this will make it so I wrote things\
myself and then I don't feel like I have to stick to something someone else\
designed. I can easily edit my own Components as needed!

## Current Components

- [Form]

[Form]: ./src/Components/Form/README.md
